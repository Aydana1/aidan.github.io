# Data Scientist

## About Me
I studied Computer Science in my bachelor degree at Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan üá∞üáø. I did research in robotics ü§ñ during my junior year and had my first paper published. I had summer internship at KAUST in molecular visualization üß¨ and computer graphics. I participated in hackathons, did side projects and launched a React Native mobile app.  I completed MSc in Computer Vision at MBZUAI and successfully defended my thesis üë©üèª‚Äçüéì. My thesis result was accepted as a conference paper to VISAPP 2023 (part of VISSIGRAPP).
